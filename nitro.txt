# It is an example of how they will look
Remember to put your webhook so that the codes that do work are sent to your Webhook, all the codes will come to nitro.txt but the ones that work will go to the Webhook you provided since this Discord Nitro Gen, unlike many, has a Checker that will check the nitros if they are functional, so it can be a little slower than normal
PS: Every time you close and open the program, the nitros saved in nitro.txt will be deleted to make way for the new codes
